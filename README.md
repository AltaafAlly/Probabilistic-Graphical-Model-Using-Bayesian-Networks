# Probabilistic Graphical Model Assignment Using Bayesian Networks

## Description:
This repository contains my assignment submission for the Probabilistic Graphical Model (PGM) course. The assignment required the utilization of PGM concepts to address a domain-specific problem within the realm of artificial intelligence. For this assignment, I chose to explore the application of PGMs in the field of mental health analysis.

## Dataset:
The dataset used for this assignment is from Jikadara, B. (n.d.). Mental Health Dataset [Data set]. Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikjikadara/mental-health-dataset. It comprises various factors influencing an individual's mental health, including demographics, lifestyle choices, medical history, and socio-economic status.

## Objective:
The primary objective of this assignment is to leverage the PGM framework to determine whether an individual should receive treatment for mental health concerns based on the factors present in the dataset. By constructing a graphical model, I aimed to capture the complex dependencies between different variables and use probabilistic inference to make informed decisions regarding treatment recommendations.

## Contents:
1. **Report.pdf**: This document provides a detailed explanation of the methodology adopted, including the construction of the graphical model, data preprocessing steps, model training, and inference procedures.
   
2. **Code/**:
    - **Main.ipynb**: Main script for model implementation and inference.
   
3. **Dataset/**:
    - **mental_health_data.csv**: Raw dataset used for analysis.
    - **filled_dataset_encoding.csv**: Cleaned and preprocessed dataset ready for model training.

## Usage:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   
2. Ensure Python and required libraries (e.g., numpy, pandas, pgmpy) are installed.
   
3. Navigate to the Code directory and run `main.ipynb` to execute the model and generate treatment recommendations.
   
4. Refer to the report for detailed insights into the methodology and results obtained.

## Conclusion:
This assignment showcases the practical application of Probabilistic Graphical Models in addressing real-world problems, particularly in the domain of mental health analysis. By leveraging the rich probabilistic framework of PGMs, we can effectively model complex dependencies and provide valuable insights for decision-making processes.
